This project is a server application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It demonstrates how to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with MongoDB, implement indexing for efficient querying, and use validation rules to ensure data consistency.

## Features

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side application.
- **Express**: A minimal web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- **CRUD API**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations implemented using Express and MongoDB.
- **MongoDB Indexing**: Indexes are created to optimize query performance.
- **Validation Rules**: MongoDB schema validation to ensure data consistency.
